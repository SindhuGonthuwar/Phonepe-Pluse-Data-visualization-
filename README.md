# Phonepe-Pluse-Data-visualization-
*PhonePe has become one of the most popular digital payment platforms in India, with millions of users relying on it for their day-to-day transactions. The app is known for its simplicity, user-friendly interface, and fast and secure payment processing. It has also won several awards and accolades for its innovative features and contributions to the digital payments industry.

*We create a web app to analyse the Phonepe transaction and users depending on various Years, Quarters, States, and Types of transaction and give a Geographical and Geo visualization output based on given requirements.The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.

1.Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

2.Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

3.Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in a MySQL database.

4.Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

5.Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
